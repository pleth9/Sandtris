# AI

I have my CNN file as well as my training script in [AI](AI/) folder. Unfortunately, as of 8/13/25, I need my computer back for work reasons, so I cannot continue training this AI.
Please feel free to make a PR with your updated training script/brains! I am greatly curious as to how the reward function can be improved alongside other parts of the training process!

## If we get enough brains, we can go from a plethora of bees to a hive mind of brains!
